    <h3> « I’m not doing digital » </h3> <p><br/></p> 
    <p>Yesterday, I joined my friend Lisa for an afterwork and she introduced me for the umpteenth time as: « Guys, this is Elodie and she works in digital. »</p> 
      <p>This time, I’ve asker her: « Lisa, do you know exactly what is digital? »</p> 
      <p>She looked at me a bit confused and mubbled something like : « hmm… »</p> 
      <p>I helped her at saying : « Ok so listen: yesterday I had to buy for my 60-years-old mum her first MP3 reader who so far used to listen CDs.</p> 
      <p>She realized that now she can bring with her, her favorite songs anywhere. She realized that she no longer has to wait for coming back home to enjoying them.</p> 
      <p>2 weeks ago, I attended a baptism as a photographer. Everybody was so worried that they might never received their souvenir pictures. You know the story : you have to give your email to aunt X who will take 1 month (unless she has forgotten all about it altogether) to send it to the photographer and then, the photographer has to find out the right image file type as aunt X and her fellows don’t have smartphones yet and they are still expect to be able to print their pictures.</p> <p>I found the way to reassure them saying that I have an online portfolio that I will share with them so that either on mobile or on desktop, they’ll have the option to get their souvenir pictures online or to print them.</p> <p>So Lisa, are you realizing that something is changing? You don’t listen music the same way than 10 years ago. You can share your souvenir pictures and keep them with you at all times without need to have them physically nor to put them in a specific place in your flat.You can go abroad right now without any worries to wait few months for seeing me again thanks to visio. » She told me that: «sure.»</p> <p>I’ve answered her: « great, so you’re probably also realizing that you can make all these things thanks to new technologies which permit you to get rid of inconveniences of physical properties. »</p> 
      <p>She told me: « Definitely. »</p> 
      <p>That’s why I’ve answered: « Ok so this is digital which means « all available in electronic form; readable and manipulable by computer¹ ».</p> 
      <p>This is also the aim of a digital economy which revolutionise our way of communicating, of working together, of prioritizing our time since 30 years. »</p> <p>Thus, jobs which appeared with Industrial then Financial Revolution will be readjusted through this 3rd Revolution. For instance, yesterday a human ressources manager had to check all administrative stuff related to you as employee such as the respect of your working hours (35 working hours in France for example) Today, there are online platforms such as Ilucca which do this job for you. Realizing this 2 years ago, I’ve decided to acquire skills which will allow me to understand how this new economy is working and how to adapt to all changes to come.» Women in tech who are collaborating</p>

      <h3>« …I’m learning how to be efficient in a digital world. » </h3> 
      <p><br/></p> 
      <p>Thus, I’ve decided to get work experiences in two different companies: a « start-up » media agency and a leading nutrition company. In both companies, I was so surprised to realize that the awareness of this digital economy wasn’t so obvious for most of my colleagues. Indeed, my team used to be considered as « a race apart ». « You are the Digital ones! » « How many likes do we have on Facebook? ». We were really considered as doing something amusing, pretty simple and even pointless in a business-oriented vision. That is pretty right that we were having a lot of fun but we were also facing new challenges never experienced so far: for example, when I was working for the nutrition company, we were experienced some great technical problems with our e-commerce platform…but our development team was located in India where there is like 10 hours of jetlag!</p> <p>This was the kind of issues that made so obvious the need to adapt 19th/20th century-company structure to the new rules of productivity in digital economy. Regarding the company annual strategic plan, we were also used to be put aside. For instance, there was a budget for commercial department, marketing and for « digital stuff » (e-commerce and CRM). Thus, digital was considered as a department and not as a market nor the essence of a global strategy which seems quite problematic when you see than for example in Europe, 47% are e-shoppers². There was also this difference between « marketing » and « digital marketing » which doesn’t seem relevant nowadays. Marketing teams used to do events, online partnerships, launches of new products. Digital Marketing teams used to be solicited for social media actions only. Nevertheless, as Ivan Menezes, CEO’s Diageo said : “It is not about doing ‘digital marketing’, it is about marketing effectively in a digital world”³ That’s why, in addition to work experiences, I’ve decided to join this Digital Business Strategy Advanced Master.</p> <ol> <li>*digital.
